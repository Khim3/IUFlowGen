Unbox and Inspect the Phone
Carefully unbox your new phone and remove any plastic covers, stickers, or 
protective films from the device. Check if all the necessary accessories are included
—typically, you should find a charging cable, power adapter, SIM ejector tool, and 
documentation such as a user manual or warranty card. If anything is missing, contact
the retailer or manufacturer before proceeding. Some phones come with a preinstalled screen protector—if yours does, decide whether to keep it or replace it with 
a higher-quality one for better durability and scratch resistance.
Insert SIM Card and Optional Memory Card
Before turning on the phone, locate the SIM card tray, usually found on the side of 
the device. Use the SIM ejector tool provided in the box, or a paperclip, to open the 
tray. Insert the SIM card in the correct orientation—check the small icon near the tray
for guidance. If your phone supports microSD cards, you can also insert one now to 
expand storage. Carefully push the tray back in until it clicks into place. If your 
phone supports eSIM technology, you can skip this step and activate the eSIM later in
the setup process.
Power On the Device
Press and hold the power button for a few seconds until the manufacturer’s logo 
appears on the screen. If the phone doesn’t turn on, check whether the battery is low
—plug it into the charger and let it charge for at least 15 minutes before trying again. 
If the phone still does not power on, inspect the charger and cable by testing them 
with another device. Once powered on, wait for the phone’s startup sequence to 
complete before moving on to the next step.
Choose Language and Region
The first screen will prompt you to select your preferred language and region. This 
setting determines your keyboard layout, time zone, and some regional features, such 
as currency formats and available apps in the app store. Choosing the correct region 
is important, as some system features may be restricted if set incorrectly. If you travel
frequently and need a different regional setting later, you may have to reset the 
phone, so choose carefully at this stage.
Connect to Wi-Fi or Mobile Network
To proceed with the setup, connect your phone to the internet. If you have access to a 
Wi-Fi network, select it from the list and enter the password. If you inserted a SIM 
card earlier, your phone may automatically connect to the mobile network and enable
data services. For eSIM users, this is the stage where you can activate your eSIM by 
scanning a QR code or entering the activation details provided by your carrier. If 
there are any connectivity issues, try moving closer to the router, ensuring the Wi-Fi 
password is correct, or restarting the phone.
Sign in or Create a Google/Apple ID
Signing in with your Google Account (Android) or Apple ID (iPhone) is essential to 
access cloud backups, app stores, and security features. If you already have an 
account, enter your credentials and proceed. If you have forgotten your password, use
the "Forgot Password" option to reset it. If you don’t have an account, you can create 
one now by following the on-screen instructions. Signing in also enables features 
such as Find My Device, which helps track your phone if lost.
Restore from Backup or Set Up as New
At this stage, you’ll be given the option to restore from a backup or set up the phone 
as a new device. If you have a previous backup stored on Google Drive (Android) or 
iCloud (iPhone), selecting this option will automatically retrieve your apps, contacts, 
settings, and photos. If switching from another phone, you might have the option to 
transfer data wirelessly via a QR code or a transfer cable. If you prefer to start fresh, 
simply set up the phone as a new device and configure all settings manually. Once 
this step is complete, the process merges, and all users move forward with security 
setup.
Set Up Security and Biometrics
To protect your phone, you need to configure a screen lock. Choose a PIN, pattern, or
password to secure your device. If your phone supports biometric authentication, you 
can also enable fingerprint unlock or face recognition for faster access. Follow the 
on-screen instructions to scan your fingerprint or face multiple times to ensure 
accurate detection. If security setup is skipped, the phone remains unprotected, and 
anyone can access it—so enabling at least a PIN is recommended.
Install Software Updates and Essential Apps
Before using your phone, check for pending software updates to ensure you have the 
latest security patches and features. To do this, navigate to Settings > Software 
Update and tap Check for Updates. If an update is available, download and install it 
while the phone is still connected to Wi-Fi. After the update, open the Google Play 
Store (Android) or Apple App Store (iPhone) and download essential apps such as 
messaging apps, social media, email, and productivity tools. If your phone comes 
with bloatware (pre-installed apps) that you don’t need, go to Settings > Apps to 
disable or uninstall them.
Final Checks and Customization
Now that the phone is fully set up, perform some final checks to ensure everything 
works correctly. Make a test call to verify that the SIM card is activated, send a text 
message, and check that mobile data and Wi-Fi connections are stable. Open the 
camera app and take a photo to confirm that both the front and rear cameras function 
properly. Play a video or song to test the speakers and microphone. If biometric 
security was set up earlier, try unlocking the phone using a fingerprint or facial 
recognition to ensure it responds accurately.
After verifying that all functions are working, personalize your phone by adjusting 
settings such as brightness, enabling dark mode, changing notification sounds, and 
setting up widgets like a clock or weather updates. Organize your home screen by 
moving frequently used apps into folders for easier access. Finally, review privacy 
and security settings, enabling Find My Device in case your phone is lost and 
activating automatic backups to prevent data loss.
With everything configured, your phone is now fully set up and ready to use! If any 
minor issues arise, a simple restart can resolve most problems. Whether you restored 
from a backup or started fresh, your device is now optimized for your needs, and 
you’re ready to enjoy all its features.
