      "- Fill a large pot with plenty of water—about 4-6 cups per serving of pasta.\n",
      "- The importance of using enough water is to give the pasta room to cook evenly and prevent it from becoming sticky.\n",
      "- Place the pot on the stove over high heat until it reaches a rolling boil, characterized by big, continuous bubbles rapidly breaking on the surface.\n",
      "- Avoid adding pasta before the water is boiling to ensure even cooking.\n",

      "  - Use about a tablespoon of salt for a large pot.\n",
      "  - Seasoning from within enhances the flavor profile of the pasta significantly.\n",
      "  - Ensure the water tastes slightly salty, similar to seawater. This ensures that even if the pasta itself seems bland, it will still be properly seasoned when mixed with sauce. \n",
      "  - The pasta absorbs only a small amount of salt, so there is no need to worry about over-salting.\n",

      "- The action involves carefully adding your pasta to the boiling water.\n",
      "- For long pasta types like spaghetti, hold it in the center and let the ends slowly bend into the water as they soften.\n",
      "- For shorter pasta types such as penne or fusilli, simply pour them in.\n",

      "**Action:** Scoop out and save pasta water  \n",
      "**Entities:** Pasta, Starchy cooking water, Ladle or measuring cup  \n",
      "**Relevant Info:** Before draining the pasta, reserve about a cup of starchy cooking water. This water contains starch from the pasta, which helps thicken sauces and makes them cling better. Even if it seems unnecessary at first, having this on hand can be useful; adding a splash to a sauce that looks too thick or dry can help achieve a smooth, silky texture.\n",

      "**Relevant Info:** The pasta should be drained once it is cooked to your desired doneness. Use a colander to remove the excess water. Avoid rinsing the pasta under cold water unless you are making a pasta salad, as rinsing removes starch that helps the sauce stick. If using a sauce, transfer the pasta back into the pot or directly into the sauce while still warm for better flavor absorption.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Relevant Info:**\n",
      "- **Timing:** The mixing should occur while the pasta is still hot to enhance flavor absorption.\n",
      "- **Consistency Adjustment:** If the sauce appears too thick or does not adhere well, add a little reserved pasta water incrementally until the desired texture and cling are achieved.\n",
      "- **Flavor Integration:** Letting the pasta and sauce simmer together for about a minute allows their flavors to blend effectively. \n",

      "  **Label:** Testing texture by biting\n",
      "\n",
      "**Relevant Information:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The step '4. Cook Until Al Dente' involves you, the cook, actively engaging with the pasta to ensure it achieves the desired al dente texture. This action requires attention to both the pasta and the package instructions for an approximate cooking time. By testing a piece of pasta about a minute before reaching the suggested time, you can determine if it is fully cooked yet retains a firm bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the pasta is too soft or mushy, it indicates overcooking; conversely, if it remains hard in the center, more cooking time is necessary. Achieving al dente texture ensures that the pasta holds its shape and absorbs sauce effectively, enhancing both flavor and consistency when served. This step underscores the importance of precision in timing to achieve optimal results in pasta preparation.\n",

    "You are a DOT code expert. Your task is to modify and beautify the following DOT code. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify the inter-cluster connections so that instead of linking entire subgraphs (e.g., cluster_1 -> cluster_2), the edges connect specific nodes (node-to-node) within the subgraphs. For example, use the last significant entity in one subgraph (such as entity_1_4 in cluster_1) and connect it to the first significant entity in the next subgraph (such as entity_2_1 in cluster_2 with its previous cluster as lhead and ltail is the next cluster). Use appropriate labels for these connections, such as:\n",
    "   entity_1_4 -> entity_2_1 [label=\"Boiling water ready\", ltail=cluster_1, lhead=cluster_2];\n",
    "   entity_2_1 -> entity_3_1 [label=\"Salted boiling water\", ltail=cluster_2, lhead=cluster_3];\n",

    "   entity_7_1 -> entity_8_1 [label=\"Serve pasta\", ltail=cluster_7, lhead=cluster_8];\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Beautify the overall DOT code by choosing an ideal layout. For example, enforce a top-to-bottom layout (`rankdir=\"TB\"`) and ensure nodes have a clean, consistent shape (`node [shape=box];`) and also (`compund = true;`) to link subgraph. Retain all subgraph attributes and styling. Make sure the number of steps (subgraphs) matches the original document.\n",

    "# You are a DOT code expert. Your task is to modify and beautify the following DOT code. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Modify the inter-cluster connections so that instead of linking entire subgraphs (e.g., cluster_1 -> cluster_2), the edges connect specific nodes (node-to-node) within the subgraphs. For example, use the last significant entity in one subgraph (such as entity_1_4 in cluster_1) and connect it to the first significant entity in the next subgraph (such as entity_2_1 in cluster_2). Use appropriate labels for these connections, such as:\n",
    "#    - entity_1_4 -> entity_2_1 [label=\"Boiling water ready\"];\n",
    "#    - entity_2_1 -> entity_3_1 [label=\"Salted boiling water\"];\n",

    "#    - entity_7_1 -> entity_8_1 [label=\"Serve pasta\"];\n",
    "\n",
