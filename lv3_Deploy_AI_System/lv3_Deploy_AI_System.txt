Choose Infrastructure (Cloud or On-Prem)
Begin by evaluating the operational paradigm most suitable for deploying your AI 
workloads. Public cloud environments—offered by vendors such as AWS, Azure, or 
Google Cloud—provide access to elastic compute, managed Kubernetes orchestration, 
and integrated storage and monitoring stacks. These platforms are highly adaptable and 
particularly advantageous in use cases that demand scalability, rapid provisioning, and 
minimal infrastructure maintenance. Alternatively, if data localization laws, compliance 
requirements, or latency-sensitive inference demand localized control, an on-premise 
deployment may be necessary. In this scenario, you'll assume complete responsibility for 
hardware, networking, and cluster management. If cloud deployment is selected, 
continue with Provision Cloud Infrastructure. If an on-premise approach is chosen, 
proceed to Set Up Bare-Metal or VMs.
Provision Cloud Infrastructure
Within the cloud model, begin by provisioning GPU-accelerated instances capable of 
supporting high-throughput inference workloads. Deploy a container orchestration layer 
using managed Kubernetes services like EKS, AKS, or GKE. IAM roles must be tightly 
scoped, virtual networks properly segmented, and storage classes defined to support 
both ephemeral and persistent data flows. Leverage Terraform or Pulumi to codify your 
infrastructure so that environments remain reproducible and auditable. Configure 
telemetry agents, centralized logging, and secrets management integrations (e.g., AWS 
Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault) to ensure compliance with security and observability
baselines. Once your cloud control plane and supporting services are in place, continue 
with Select Model Serving Platform.
Set Up Bare-Metal or VMs
For on-premise deployment, provision physical servers or virtual machines equipped with 
compatible GPUs such as the NVIDIA A100 or H100. Container runtime environments like 
Docker or CRI-O must be installed and configured, and Kubernetes orchestration should 
be bootstrapped via kubeadm, Rancher, or equivalent tooling. Networking must be 
explicitly defined using static IP assignment, internal DNS, and possibly VLAN tagging. 
High-throughput local storage—typically NVMe-based—should be mounted using LVM or 
RAID strategies. Security measures such as firewall zoning, VPN tunneling, and devicelevel hardening are essential. Following this foundational setup, continue with Select 
Model Serving Platform.
Select Model Serving Platform
Next, identify a model inference engine compatible with your deployment goals and 
supported model formats. NVIDIA Triton Inference Server, TensorFlow Serving, or 
TorchServe are among the preferred options, especially where dynamic batching, GPU 
multiplexing, or multi-model deployment is required. Encapsulate the model, its 
preprocessing pipeline, and health-check interfaces within a container. Define exposure 
methods via REST or gRPC depending on downstream system compatibility. Helm or 
Kustomize can be employed to template deployments and ensure repeatability across 
environments. After your model serving platform is prepared, proceed to Deploy 
Inference Controller.
Deploy Inference Controller
Deploy the model-serving containers into your orchestration fabric using StatefulSets or 
Deployments, depending on whether session affinity or persistence is needed. Set up 
ConfigMaps for runtime parameters and Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive credentials. 
Attach PersistentVolumeClaims if model files are dynamically pulled or logs are retained. 
Use Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA) or KEDA to scale replicas based on system load or 
request frequency. Apply node selectors, tolerations, and affinity rules to bind workloads 
to GPU-enabled nodes. Include readiness and liveness probes to support high availability. 
Once the inference infrastructure is deployed, branch immediately into parallel 
configuration of the following components: Set Up Input Channels, Set Up Output & 
Storage Systems, Install Metrics & Addons, and Configure RBAC & Security.
Set Up Input Channels
Enable ingress paths that feed real-time or batch inputs into your inference service. This 
may involve HTTP endpoints, WebSocket streams, or message queue subscribers using 
Kafka or RabbitMQ. Input schemas must be enforced using validation libraries, and 
authentication mechanisms such as OAuth2 or JWT must be implemented at entry points.
Leverage API gateways or mesh ingress controllers like Istio Gateway or Envoy Proxy to 
manage routing, retries, and rate limiting. Ensure that trace and correlation IDs are 
attached to each inbound request for auditability and observability. Because these entry 
points are externally exposed, ensure that their configuration is tightly coupled with the 
RBAC and security policies defined in Configure RBAC & Security to maintain a secure 
interface surface.
Set Up Output & Storage Systems
Configure output pipelines to persist prediction results or forward them downstream. 
Structured outputs may be directed to relational databases like PostgreSQL, while 
unstructured blobs or batch exports can be sent to object stores like Amazon S3 or Azure 
Blob. Redis or Memcached can support short-lived caching of responses. Ensure 
encryption at rest for all output data and enable TLS across all outbound interfaces. 
Streaming outputs to data pipelines or dashboards may require CDC mechanisms or 
dedicated connectors. Integrate output metadata with data catalogs for lineage tracking 
and auditing. Once output storage is operational, the system is ready to accept and 
persist results from live inference traffic.
Install Metrics & Addons
Deploy observability tooling that enables visibility into all operational aspects of the 
system. Prometheus should be configured to scrape performance and system metrics, 
while Grafana visualizes latency and throughput. Fluent Bit or Fluentd can route logs to 
Elasticsearch, Loki, or a central SIEM platform. Use OpenTelemetry to instrument 
distributed traces and correlate service spans. Define dashboards that reflect system 
health, SLOs, and capacity planning trends. Set up alerts for anomalies, errors, and 
degradation, notifying responders via channels such as Slack, PagerDuty, or Opsgenie. 
Once observability components are in place and verified, continue to Validate the AI 
System to monitor system behavior under realistic conditions.
Configure RBAC & Security
Apply RBAC policies within Kubernetes to restrict access to APIs, secrets, and runtime 
logs. Enforce mTLS between services to prevent eavesdropping and service spoofing. Use
ingress controllers to filter inbound IPs and limit request rates. Secrets must be managed 
with tools like HashiCorp Vault, Sealed Secrets, or external secrets operators. Perform 
static and dynamic scans of containers, and enforce AppArmor or SELinux profiles on 
nodes to restrict privileged operations. Where applicable, implement DLP scanners to 
prevent exfiltration of sensitive data through inputs or outputs. Once these security 
controls are fully applied, proceed to Validate the AI System to finalize the secure 
deployment perimeter.
Validate the AI System
Final system validation includes stress testing, behavioral verification, and resiliency 
analysis. Tools like Locust, Artillery, or k6 simulate user demand and reveal performance 
boundaries. Confirm that autoscaling logic triggers correctly and that observability data 
reflects real-time system conditions. Authentication and authorization flows must be retested under load. End-to-end trace analysis should be conducted to ensure no 
bottlenecks exist across the inference path. Outputs are validated against test datasets 
or live sampling tools. If validation exposes critical issues—such as misconfigurations, 
failed routing, or unmet performance thresholds—you must rollback to Deploy Inference 
Controller, revise deployment manifests, and re-execute the deployment iteration. Upon 
successful validation, the system may be marked production-ready and released under a 
monitored rollout policy.
